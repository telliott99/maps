pandas is obtained by using pip

A data frame is a table with named rows and columns 
whose individual columns may have data of different types.

  fips   value
 01001       1

A simple way to construct such a table is to provide a
dictionary to the DataFrame constructor:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> data = {'fips':['01001'], 'value':[1] }
>>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)
>>> df.head()
    fips  value
0  01001      1
>>>

Frequently, the data comes from a csv file:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
>>> df.head()
   fips  value
0  1001      1
>>>

Notice that this is not quite right.
The leading zero on fips has been stripped.

The reason is that the datatype has been inferred to be integer.

>>> df.dtypes
fips     int64
value    int64
dtype: object
>>>

To fix this, specify;

>>> df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', dtype={'fips': str})
>>> df.head()
    fips  value
0  01001      1
>>> df.dtypes
fips     object
value     int64
dtype: object
>>>
