The standard projection used in converting latitudes and longitudes on the (roughly) spherical earth to a planar map depends on what you're projecting.

Most people know about the Mercator projection.  The one used extensively for the United States is called the Albers projection.

I'll put the code elsewhere (it's always a pain to format for LaTeX).  This discussion is about implementing the math.

\subsection*{spherical case}

The idealized spherical earth is a bit easier, so we'll go through that first, and then talk about the earth as an ellipsoid.

What you must do first is to pick two reference latitudes.  These are referred to in the following by the letter $\phi$.  So the reference latitudes are $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$.

The standards are:  lower 48 states $29.5, 45.5$, Alaska: $55, 65$, and Hawaii $8,18$.

You also pick a center for the map labeled as longitude $\phi_0$ and latitude $\lambda_0$.

$R$ is a given constant.  For the spherical case it is $1.0$.

We use the above constants to calculate 

\[ n = \frac{1}{2}(\sin \phi_1 + \sin \phi_2) \]
\[ C = \cos^2 \phi_1 + 2n \sin \phi_1 \]
\[ \rho_0 =  \frac{R}{n} \ \sqrt{C - 2n \sin \phi_0} \]

$n$ $C$ and $\rho_0$ are the same for all calculations for a given projection center and reference latitudes.

The next calculation, for $\rho$, requires each individual $\phi$:

\[ \rho = \frac{R}{n} \ \sqrt{C - 2n \sin \phi} \]

$\theta$ depends on $\lambda$:
\[ \theta = n(\lambda - \lambda_0) \]

Given the three values $\theta$, $\rho$ and $\rho_0$, we can calculate $(x,y)$ according to:

\[ x = \rho \sin \theta \]
\[ y = \rho_0 - \rho \cos \theta \]

So finally, we can process a series of tuples $\phi, \lambda$ to convert them to Cartesian $(x,y)$ coordinates.

Three more values can be calculated:  $h, k$ and $\omega$.  The first two are the scales of the plot, and the $\omega$ is the maximum angular deformation.

This projection preserves areas, but allows deformation of angles.

\subsection*{ellipsoid}

There are two additional factors for the ellipsoid, which I'm guessing relate to the semi-major axis and eccentricity:   $a$ and $e$.

$q_1$ and $q_2$ are calculated based on the reference latitudes $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$.

\[ q = (1-e^2) \ [ \  \frac{\sin \phi}{(1- e^2 \sin^2 \phi)} - \frac{1}{2e} \ ] \ [ \ \ln \ \frac{1 - e \sin \phi}{1 + e \sin \phi} \ ] \]

$m$ depends on each individual $\phi$:

\[ m = \frac{\cos \phi}{(1 - e^2 \sin^2 \phi)^{1/2}} \]

Then
\[ n = \frac{m_1^2 - m_2^2}{q_2 - q_1} \]
\[ C = m_1^2 + nq_1^2 \]
\[ \rho_0 = \frac{a \sqrt{C - nq_0)} }{n} \]

As before, $n$ $C$ and $\rho_0$ are the same for all calculations for a given projection center and reference latitudes.

\[ \rho = \frac{a \sqrt{C - nq)} }{n} \]
\[ \theta = n (\lambda = \lambda_0) \]

and as before

\[ x = \rho \sin \theta \]
\[ y = \rho_0 - \rho \cos \theta \]

Inverse formulas are also given for both cases.  Let us turn to page 291 of the reference.

\subsection*{numerical example, spherical case}

Given:

Radius of the sphere:
\[ R = 1.0 \]
Standard parallels:
\[ \phi_1 = 29.5^{\circ} \text{N}. \]
\[ \phi_2 = 45.5^{\circ} \text{N}. \]
Origin:
\[ \phi_0 = 23^{\circ} \text{N}. \]
\[ \lambda_0 = 96^{\circ} \text{W}. \]

The given point is $(35^{\circ} \text{N}., 75^{\circ} \text{W}.)$.

See the accompanying script for the calculations.  We match the text.
